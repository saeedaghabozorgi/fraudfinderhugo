Run `2_model_training_custom_xgboost_experiment.ipynb` in the Workbench.
This notebook shows how to pull your data from Feature Store for training, run data exploratory analysis on your data, build a machine learning model locally, experiment with various hyperparameters, evaluate the model and deloy it to a Vertex AI endpoint. 


In this notebook, you will learn how to:

* Use a Feature Store to pull training data
* Do some exploratory analysis on the extracted data
* Train the model and track the results using Vertex Experiments
