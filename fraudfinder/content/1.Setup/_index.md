## Getting Started

If it is a GCP event, you should have an account, username and Password. The project, the sample dataset and Vertex AI is already setup for you. So, you can jump into Lab0.

If you are running this workshop in your own project, you should setup the environment. To start this workshop, if you have not already, you should setup GCP project first, and then login.
In this section, weâ€™ll do the following:

* Vertex AI setup
* Launch a user-managed notebook
* Setup permissions
* Cloning the FraudFinder repository
