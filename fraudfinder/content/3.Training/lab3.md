This notebook shows how to get your training dataset from Vertex AI Feature Store, train your model using Vertex AI managed training pipeline, and deployment it into Vertex AI endpoint. You will learn how to use your own custom code for ML training on Vertex AI.

In this notebook, you will learn how to:

* Build a containers to run your own custom code on Vertex AI
* Use Vertex AI to train your model at scale
* Use Vertex AI to create an endpoint
