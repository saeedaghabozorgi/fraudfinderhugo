This section discusses techniques for implementing and automating continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous training (CT) for machine learning (ML) systems.

Data science and ML are becoming core capabilities for solving complex real-world problems, transforming industries, and delivering value in all domains. Currently, the ingredients for applying effective ML are available to you:

Large datasets
Inexpensive on-demand compute resources
Specialized accelerators for ML on various cloud platforms
Rapid advances in different ML research fields (such as computer vision, natural language understanding, and recommendations AI systems).
Therefore, many businesses are investing in their data science teams and ML capabilities to develop predictive models that can deliver business value to their users.
